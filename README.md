# [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org)

Hello! The p5.js Web Editor is an in-browser editor for creative coding, specifically for writing [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketches. p5.js, a separate [open source project](https://github.com/processing/p5.js), is a JavaScript library with the goal of making coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. The web editor shares the same spirit as p5.jsâ€“it is designed with the beginner in mind. When using the web editor, you don't need to download or configure anything, you can simply open the website, and start writing code. You can also host your work online and share it with others.
